    h2  My target reference model for the Model-Driven Node.  This diagram represents what a real enterprise-level organization could look like with componentized node.js applications organized into an holistic system. This example has 2000 auto-generated models, collections, test data and API derived from open source xsd schemas created by the <a href="http://www.opentravel.org">Open Travel Alliance</a> and the <a href="http://www.starstandard.org">Star Standard for Automobile Retail.</a>

    h2  Essentially, I've created a fair bit of the infrastructure of a significant enterprise application in about 120 hours of work, but I wrote a generation tool, not the foundation code, so I can duplicate it for other schemas in a few minutes now.
