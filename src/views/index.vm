    p This page is part of the preceding diagram.  You're running the reference implementation right now.  This site was generated with 15 java classes, 15 velocity templates, 2 xsd schemas to demonstrate what an enterprise-level suite might look like with componentized node.js applications. 

  h2
    p App A has 1152 auto-generated models (tables), collections, test data and API derived from an open source xsd schema created by the <a href="http://www.opentravel.org">Open Travel Alliance</a>.   App B has 995 models generated from <a href="http://www.starstandard.org">Star Standard for Automobile Retail</a> and there's approximately 2 million test records at the moment.

  h2
    p I created this enterprise application in 120 hours but with a generation tool instead of by writing basic code, so now I can create a new application in a few minutes.  A real e-commerce site would probably need less than 100 java classes, less than 100 velocity templates and 1 xsd schema.
  h2
    p The real value of the model-driven node is dynamic regeneration of all associated parts as the xsd schema evolves; the parts hold together more consistently and require less testing.  In fact, in previous projects, we also generated many of our unit and integration tests using velocity templates.
